# shadow_workloadtracker
This web tool was originally built by Katy Williams ('17) as part of Project PRONTO, an initiative started by Dr. Laurie Heyer of Davidson College in order to provide web-based tools that streamline tasks for campus and community partners. The Workload Tracker was originally a very large, difficult-to-wield Excel file that was used to keep track of every professor, the committees each professor was on, and the number of "work points" each professor and committee had. Hermon Mulat ('18) and Ashley Alexander-Lee ('17) built on Williams' work to make the Online Workload Tracker 2.0, which will be used by the college this year to keep track of the workload of the professors as well as to aid in the election process for the committees.

This tool was built for faculty members as well as the administrative committee in charge of keeping track of the workloads. Hence why the sections "Search for faculty by name/workload" and "Committee Information" are on the homepage and accessible to all users. At the bottom of the window, if you click "Administrator Tools", you'll notice that all users have access to these pages but making any changes requires a password.

The password used is 'demo' and can be changed in the `check.py' file. We recommend using a more secure password method; however, this is useful for demonstration purposes.
